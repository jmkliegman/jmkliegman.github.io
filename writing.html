<h4><strong>PolitiFact</strong></h4>


<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/aug/14/bill-foster/60-percent-st-petersburg-car-thefts-due-keys-left-/" target="_blank">60 percent of St. Petersburg car thefts due to keys left in car, mayor says</a>: This is something St. Petersburg, Fla. Mayor Bill Foster said in a 2013 mayoral forum. I was skeptical of the high number he cited. After talking to crime experts and the police department, I discovered the real number is even higher. This story also <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/local/60-percent-of-st-petersburg-car-thefts-due-to-keys-left-in-car-mayor-says/2136467" target="_blank">ran on the front page</a> of the Tampa Bay Times.</li><br />
	
	<li><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/27/bookerfail/super-pac-criticizes-booker-low-newark-graduation-/" target="_blank">Super PAC criticizes Booker for low Newark graduation rate</a>: A conservative super PAC criticized U.S. Senate candidate Cory Booker, D-N.J., even after receiving a donation from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. But a look into how education funding works in Newark reveals that the situation is much more complicated. I broke down the context of Newark's low graduation rate, as well as the long process of using Zuckerberg's funds to meet city and state educational goals.</li><br />

	<li><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/09/tom-cotton/aca-marketplaces-have-no-privacy-protections-cotto/" target="_blank">The health care marketplaces have 'no privacy protections,' Cotton says</a>: Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., was one of many House GOP Obamacare critics. When <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov">healthcare.gov</a> launched on Oct. 1, 2013, its glitches became a popular target. Cotton claimed there's no mechanism in place to collect sensitive consumer data, but cybersecurity experts told me otherwise.</li><br />

<h4><strong>The Record</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/071910_Maywood_center_applauds_advance_of_bill_to_aid_stroke_victims.html" target="_blanks">Maywood center applauds advance of bill to aid stroke victims</a>: Maywood was one of the towns on my beat during summer 2010. While driving through town in search of stories, I happened upon a facility aiding people who had suffered from brain trauma. With a strong push from these patients, the state of New Jersey passed a bill that would improve funding for their needs.  </li><br />
	<li><a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/100241989_Volunteers_struggle_to_pay_for_training.html" target="_blank">Volunteers struggle to pay for training</a>: As statewide funding decreased for volunteer EMT workers, I looked into how northern Jersey towns are coping with the changes.  </li><br />
	<li><a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/99159919_Mayor_protests_Rte__17_proposal.html" target="_blank">Rochelle Park mayor leading charge against Route 17 expansion</a>: This story is from a rare moment when sitting through a long town council meeting pays off. Then-Mayor Frank Valenzuela stood up for his town in the fight to help out his business owners and residents.</li>

<h4><strong>El Nuevo Día</strong></h4>

	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.elnuevodia.com/lastendenciassuicidaspuedensuperarse-1204262.html" target="_blank">Las tendencias suicidas pueden superarse</a>: I took an in-depth look at statistics from the past decade to determine whether there has been a trend in suicides on the island and, if so, why. I spoke to experts but also got crucial firsthand narratives from formerly suicidal individuals.</li><br />
	<li><a href="http://www.elnuevodia.com/elempresarismocomoalternativa-1209772.html" target="_blank">El empresarismo como alternativa</a>: In a rough economy, young people are looking to start up their own businesses. I walk you through their struggles and successes and provide a clear picture of what resources are available for entrepreneurial help in Puerto Rico.</li><br />
	<li><a href="http://www.elnuevodia.com/elcuriosoencantodelosmemes-1225900.html" target="_blank">El curioso encanto de los memes</a>: Meme culture is big everywhere, and Puerto Rico is no exception. Although various types of Internet jokes have been popular for ages, I noticed  a major gap: No big publications on the island had covered the topic. I went straight to the source and talked to meme creators, while getting the bigger picture from <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/" target="_blank">Know Your Meme</a>.</li>
