Finally, residents have their attention. In my third piece on the matter, I took a nuanced look at why this problem came to be and how residents are searching for answers. This story ran on page 1B.</li><br />

The crossbow industry is not regulated, so companies like Barnett Outdoors don't build thumb guards into their products. </li><br />

	<li><a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/aug/14/bill-foster/60-percent-st-petersburg-car-thefts-due-keys-left-/" target="_blank">60 percent of St. Petersburg car thefts due to keys left in car, mayor says</a>: This is something St. Petersburg, Fla. Mayor Bill Foster said in a 2013 mayoral forum. I was skeptical of the high number he cited. After talking to crime experts and the police department, I discovered the real number is even higher. This story also <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/local/60-percent-of-st-petersburg-car-thefts-due-to-keys-left-in-car-mayor-says/2136467" target="_blank">ran on the front page</a> of the Tampa Bay Times.</li><br />

But a look into how education funding works in Newark reveals that the situation is much more complicated. I broke down the context of the city's low graduation rate, as well as the long process of using Zuckerberg's funds to meet city and state educational goals.</li><br />

Cotton claimed there's no mechanism in place to collect sensitive consumer data, but cybersecurity experts told me otherwise.</li>

Netflix's <em>BoJack Horseman</em> offers a nuanced take on mental health through its subject matter and structure, while somehow still being delightfully goofy and generally hilarious.</li>

<h4><strong>The Record</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="clips/aphasia.pdf" target="_blank">Maywood center applauds advance of bill to aid stroke victims</a>: Maywood was one of the towns on my beat during summer 2010. While driving through town in search of stories, I happened upon a facility aiding people who had suffered from brain trauma. With a strong push from these patients, the state of New Jersey passed a bill that would improve funding for their needs.  </li><br />

I spoke to experts but also got crucial firsthand narratives from formerly suicidal individuals.</li><br />
	<li><a href="http://www.elnuevodia.com/elempresarismocomoalternativa-1209772.html" target="_blank">El empresarismo como alternativa</a>: In a rough economy, young people have increasingly turned to starting up their own businesses. I put a voice to their struggles and successes and provided a clear picture of what resources are available for entrepreneurial help in Puerto Rico.</li><br />
	<li><a href="http://www.elnuevodia.com/elcuriosoencantodelosmemes-1225900.html" target="_blank">El curioso encanto de los memes</a>: Meme culture is big everywhere, and Puerto Rico is no exception. Although various types of Internet jokes have been popular for ages, I noticed  a major gap: No big publications on the island had covered the topic. I went straight to the source and talked to meme creators, while getting the bigger picture from <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/" target="_blank">Know Your Meme</a>.</li>
