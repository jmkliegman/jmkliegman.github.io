<h4><strong>The Ringer</strong></h4>

<ul>

	<li><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/4/24/16038130/social-media-suicide-prevention-policies-5490c2c224e0">College athletes are only starting to get access to the mental health care they need</a>: Inspired by ESPN personality Kate Fagan's book What Made Maddy Run, I examined the slowly expanding access NCAA student-athletes have to the mental health care they need and deserve. I relayed firsthand stories from athletes who have experienced depression and eating disorders, as well as vital information from experts in the field.</li><br />

	<li><a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/10/26/16535274/ncaa-student-athletes-mental-health-care-initiatives">The new era of suicide prevention</a>: In 2017, Facebook announced it would begin using artificial intelligence to identify potentially suicidal users earlier and offer them the resources they need to get help. I took a look and how they and other social media networks impact people experiencing suicidal thoughts, and what more can be done without invading users' privacy.</li><br />

	<li><a href="https://theringer.com/the-future-of-abortion-on-tv-167342ad636d#.3dbf6po1z">The future of abortion on TV</a>: In recent years, more and more TV shows have been crafting thoughtful, understated, and sometimes even subversive plotlines about abortion. Following the inauguration of a president who poses a serious concern for proponents of reproductive rights, this representation is more important than ever. I talked to showrunners for <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em> and <em>Jane the Virgin</em> and other experts about the connection between real-life abortion-rights setbacks and onscreen story lines.</li><br />
	
	<li><a href="https://theringer.com/pitch-isn-t-just-a-fantasy-4efea323819b#.iupm7brx7" target="_blank"><em>Pitch</em> isn't just a fantasy</a>: In September 2016, Fox premiered <em>Pitch</em>, a drama featuring Ginny Baker (Kylie Bunbury) as the first woman to break into Major League Baseball. In an time when female ballplayers are seen as freakish outliers and not the norm, the show offers girls and women an exciting look at the opportunities to come for them in the sport.</li><br />

	<li><a href="https://theringer.com/bojack-horseman-asexual-representation-netflix-3c9d6c80d49d#.a1z5v2l1x" target="_blank">A quiet revolution on <em>BoJack Horseman</em></a>: TV characters don't often come out—or even think about coming out—as asexual. If <em>BoJack</em> lets Todd ponder his potential asexuality without shaming him or muting his warmhearted and patently absurd personality, the show will have succeeded in treating asexual people like actual human beings — a statement that should by no means feel bold in 2016, but, for Hollywood, would be a huge leap. I talked to advocates and viewers about Todd's impact on and the importance of asexual representation on TV.</li><br />

<h4><strong>The Establishment</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.theestablishment.co/2016/05/23/dont-compare-my-depression-to-the-flu/" target="_blank">Don't compare my depression to the flu</a>: My depression is not like your case of the flu or your brother’s diabetes or your mother-in-law's best friend's dog's asthma. I’d much rather broaden your circle of acceptable humans to include people with mental illness than have to jump through hoops squeezing my depression into a contrived metaphor.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://theweek.com/articles/576595/simpsons-shows-why-narcolepsy-no-laughing-matter" target="_blank"><em>The Simpsons</em> shows why narcolepsy is no laughing matter</a>: With its sensitivity, <em>The Simpsons</em> proves itself an anomaly in a comedic world that so often refuses to validate the experiences people with narcolepsy face on a daily basis — and the strain the disorder can put on relationships.</li><br />
	
	<li><a href="http://theweek.com/articles/578961/could-amazin-mets-actually-amazing" target="_blank">Could the Amazin' Mets actually be amazing?</a>: The New York Mets made the 2015 playoffs, marking their first postseason appearance in nearly a decade. I describe the pain of rooting for the lovable losers.</li><br />

	<li><a href="http://theweek.com/articles/607875/how-technology-making-baseball-better--even-without-robot-umpires" target="_blank">How technology is making baseball better — even without robot umpires</a>: Years of PITCHf/x technology has led to umpires adjusting their strike zones downward, which is more in line with the MLB rule book. Maybe robots will call games one day, but even with humans behind the plate, players and fans don't have it so bad.</li><br />

	<li><a href="http://themembrane.kinja.com/bojack-gets-depression-right-where-others-failed-by-jul-1680150095" target="_blank"><em>BoJack</em> gets depression right where others failed</a>: So many TV shows and movies portray depression as either insurmountable or no more serious than a day or two of ordinary sadness. Netflix's <em>BoJack Horseman</em> offers a nuanced take on mental health through its subject matter and structure, while  still being delightfully goofy and generally hilarious.

	I've also reviewed every Season 2 episode of <em>BoJack</em> for Paste. You can read my analysis <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/writers?name=julie+kliegman" target="_blank">here</a>.
